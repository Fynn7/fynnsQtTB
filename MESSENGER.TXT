THE FOLLOWING COMMIT MSG WAS SUPPOSED TO COMMIT AS WELL, BUT WASN'T

HERE IS THE COMMIT MSG:


- create resource dir in src dir
- built package
- import rsc through new path
- optimized A LOT about settings and data file:
    all changes could be applied directly without restarting the SW
- for more see devLog.md inside `docs/`
